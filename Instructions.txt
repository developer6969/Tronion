        [For all available commands -> $ php artisan list]
        $ php artisan make:migration create_posts_table

        $ php artisan make:model Category -mc (migration & controller)  
        (Use -a for all -> Model, Factory, Migration, Seeder, Controller)
T2|C13. Using model to perform business logic 
        $ php artisan tinker (starts tinker)
        Some Tinker commands :
            >>> $category = new App\Category;
            => App\Category {#3026}
            >>> $category->name = 'Wordpress';

            >>> App\Category::where('active', false)->get();
            >>> App\Category::all();

            $cat = App\Category::first();
            => App\Category {#3035
                 id: 1,
                 name: "Wordpress",

            => "So here i started doing things all by self thought i need just a little help sometimes in some areas so keep this in mind that practise is the only way to master anything cause it train your brains to think in a particular manner"
            >>> $post->save();
T4|C21. Controller with resources
        Create a model first
        $ php artisan make:model Post
        Then create controller with resources & model binding
        $ php artisan make:controller PostController --resource --model=Post

        GET /videos          [List of resources]
        GET /videos/create   [Show form for creating new resource]
        POST /videos         [Persist new video to database]
        GET /videos/:id      [Show a particular video]
        GET /videos/:id/edit [Shpw form for editing existing resource]
        PUT /videos/:id      [Persist the changes made above]
        DELETE /videos/:id   [Delete resources ]

        GET /videos/subscribe
        POST /videos/subscriptions => VideoSubscriptionController@store
T4|C23. Perform CRUD Operations via PostController

T6|C29. Eloquent Model Relations
                One To Many (User - Post)
                Many To Many
                Has One Through
                Has Many Through
                One To One (Polymorphic)
                One To Many (Polymorphic)
                Many To Many (Polymorphic)
                STEPS:-
                1. Add relation in User model
                2. Add relation in Post model
                3. Modify post migration to include user_id as coloum

        How to use Factory:-
                $ php artisan tinker
                Single User :  factory(App\User::class)->create();
                Multiple User :  factory(App\User::class, 5)->create();
                Override Column :  factory(App\Post::class, 5)->create(['user_id' => 1]);
        How to create new factory:-
                $ php artisan make:factory PostFactory -m "App\Post"
        Few Tinker commands :-
                $user = App\User::find(1);
                $user->posts;
                OR
                App\Post::find(1)->user;
